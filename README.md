# Concept

Small implementation from Formal Concept Analysis, based on the Ganter's next closure algorithm from:
Ganter B. (2010) Two Basic Algorithms in Concept Analysis. In: Kwuida L., Sertkaya B. (eds) Formal Concept Analysis.
ICFCA 2010. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 5986. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-11928-6_22

It also uses many methods presented in Ganter, Bernhard, et al. Conceptual exploration. Heidelberg: Springer, 2016.

The implementation is naive and likely to only work well with small datasets.

See the examples folder for example inputs and outputs.
